# OAS-RCE-Exploit
Online Admission System 1.0 has an issue with Access Control and allows unauthenticated user to upload malicious files, which can be executed directly from studentpics directory.
The exploit is directly resolving documents.php file bypassing authentication, uploads the PHP backdoor and then uses reverse shell payload to spawn shell.
